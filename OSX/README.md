## Workarounds
### IntelliJ can't find git executable for use in exec()
If you installed git from git-scm.org according to the instructions, you need to symlink /usr/bin/git to /usr/local/git/bin/git otherwise intellij can't find git in exec().

## Potentially useful
* [JEnv](http://www.jenv.be/) Set Java Home, locally for a given path if you want.
